	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a way to represent how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run. Efficient algorithms perform tasks in less time as the input size grows.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example of space usage is O(n), which means the memory required grows linearly with the input.</p>
